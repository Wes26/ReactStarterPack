# Welcome to React Starter Pack

## What is this and Why Should I care?
- This is a "starter pack". Each of the folders above will be an example of one thing. In the case of the `AbsolutePositioning` folder above,
for example, the only thing that will be shown is how to position a divs with respect to each other with absolute and relative positioning.
- For clarity each of the above will contain it's own react app standalone file generated from `create-react-app` (except in the case of say, UI libraries). Each can then be run in isolation by simply cd-ing into the directory and typing `npm install` and `npm start` in the terminal.
- Feel free to contribute any and all examples you may have, so long as you follow the principles of `1 folder = 1 example from create-react-app` and `Keep It Simple Stupid`
- Much ❤️
